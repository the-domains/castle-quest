filmed here! Built on a dolerite outcrop, the location was previously
home to a fort of the native Britons known as Din Guarie and may have been the
capital of the British kingdom of the region (see Gododdin, Bryneich and Hen
Ogledd)[2] from the realm's foundation in c.420 until 547, the year of the
first written reference to the castle. In that year the citadel was captured by
the Anglo-Saxon ruler Ida of Bernicia (Beornice) and became Ida's seat. It was
briefly retaken by the Britons from his son Hussa during the war of 590 before

English county of Berkshire. The castle is notable for its long association
with the English and later British royal family and also for its architecture.
The original castle was built in the 11th century after the Norman invasion by
William the Conqueror. Since the time of Henry I, it has been used by
succeeding monarchs and is the longest-occupied palace in Europe. </p></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="132"><p>The castle's
lavish, early 19th-century State Apartments are architecturally significant,
described by art historian Hugh Roberts as "a superb and unrivalled
sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of
later Georgian taste". The castle includes the 15th-century St George's
Chapel, considered by historian John Martin Robinson to be "one of the
supreme achievements of English Perpendicular Gothic" design. More than

is a late medieval
castle located just north of the village of Raglan in the county of
Monmouthshire in south east Wales. The modern castle dates from between the
15th and early 17th-centuries, when the successive ruling families of the
Herberts and the Somersets created a luxurious, fortified castle, complete with
a large hexagonal keep, known as the Great Tower or the Yellow Tower of Gwent.
Surrounded by parkland, water gardens and terraces, the castle was considered
by contemporaries to be the equal of any other in England or Wales. </p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_GhostedColumn-ac4ec467-3949-4df8-83a3-37a36e734159" class="Section

(/ˈboʊdiəm/) is a 14th-century moated castle
near Robertsbridge in East Sussex, England. It was built in 1385 by Sir Edward
Dalyngrigge, a former knight of Edward III, with the permission of Richard II,
ostensibly to defend the area against French invasion during the Hundred Years'
War. Of quadrangular plan, Bodiam Castle has no keep, having its various
chambers built around the outer defensive walls and inner courts. Its corners
and entrance are marked by towers, and topped by crenellations. Its structure,
details and situation in an artificial watery landscape indicate that display
was an important aspect of the castle's design as well as defence. It was the

fortification in Caerphilly in South Wales. The castle was constructed by
Gilbert de Clare in the 13th century as part of his campaign to conquer
Glamorgan, and saw extensive fighting between Gilbert and his descendants and
the native Welsh rulers. Surrounded by extensive artificial lakes – considered
by historian Allen Brown to be "the most elaborate water defences in all
Britain" – it occupies around 30 acres (12 ha) and is the second largest
castle in Britain.[1] It is famous for having introduced concentric castle
defences to Britain and for its large gatehouses.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="222"><p>Gilbert began work on the castle in 1268 following his
occupation of the north of Glamorgan, with the majority of the construction
occurring over the next three years at a considerable cost. The project was
opposed by Gilbert's Welsh rival Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, leading to the site
being burnt in 1270 and taken over by royal officials in 1271. Despite these
interruptions, Gilbert successfully completed the castle and took control of
the region. The core of Caerphilly Castle, including the castle's luxurious
accommodation, was built on what became a central island, surrounding by
several artificial lakes, a design Gilbert probably derived from that at
Kenilworth. The dams for these lakes were further fortified, and an island to
the west provided additional protection. The concentric rings of walls inspired
Edward I's castles in North Wales, and proved what historian Norman Pounds has
termed "a turning point in the history of the castle in Britain".[2]</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-v_GraphicalColumn3x-fee9a3c2-31bb-4415-9999-7e32f97b0e17" class="Section

It’s nice to have a pen pal or two you correspond with through real letters; being able to open the mailbox and find an envelope addressed to you is a true delight. Beyond basic correspondence, there are 7 types of letters I suggest every man write at least once before they turn 70. Each kind of letter described below covers a different part of the human experience, and provides a benefit to both the writer and the recipient (though you don’t have to send them all). The former gets to participate in the exercise of putting words to feelings, a process that can hone gratitude, humility, and perspective on life. The latter gets to open an envelope filled with comfort and encouragement.
