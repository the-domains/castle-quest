data-reactid="63"><p>Alnwick Castle (Listeni/ËˆÃ¦náµ»k/ an-ik) is a castle and
stately home in the town of Alnwick in the English county of Northumberland. It
is the seat of the Duke of Northumberland, built following the Norman conquest,
and renovated and remodelled a number of times. It is a Grade I listed
building[1] and as of 2012 received over 800,000 visitors per year.[2]</p><h2>History</h2><p>Alnwick Castle guards a road crossing the River Aln.[3] Yves
de Vescy, Baron of Alnwick, erected the first parts of the castle in about
1096.[4] The castle was first mentioned in 1136 when it was captured by King
David I of Scotland.[5] At this point it was described as "very
strong".[3] It was besieged in 1172 and again in 1174 by William the Lion,
King of Scotland and William was captured outside the walls during the Battle
of Alnwick.[6] Eustace de Vesci, lord of Alnwick, was accused of plotting with
Robert Fitzwalter against King John in 1212.[7] In response, John ordered the
demolition of Alnwick Castle and Baynard's Castle (the latter was Fitzwalter's
stronghold);[8] however, his instructions were not carried out at Alnwick.[9]</p><p>When the Vescy family became extinct, Alnwick Castle and the
surrounding manor were bequeathed to Antony Bek the Bishop of Durham.[3][9] The
Percy family benefited from England's wars with Scotland; through his military
accomplishments Henry Percy, 1st Baron Percy (1273â€“1314), enhanced his family's
status in northern England. In 1309 he purchased the barony of Alnwick[10] from
Bek, and it has been owned by the Percy family, the Earls and later Dukes of
Northumberland since.[11] The stone castle Henry Percy bought was a modest
affair, but he immediately began rebuilding. Though he did not live to see its
completion, the building programme turned Alnwick into a major fortress along
the Anglo-Scottish border. His son, also called Henry (1299â€“1352), continued the
building.[12] The Abbot's Tower, the Middle Gateway and the Constable's Tower
survive from this period.[11] The work at Alnwick Castle balanced military
requirements with the family's residential needs. It set the template for
castle renovations in the 14th century in northern England; several
palace-fortresses, considered "extensive, opulent [and] theatrical"
date from this period in the region, such as the castles of Bamburgh and
Raby.[13] In 1345 the Percys acquired Warkworth Castle, also in Northumberland.
Though Alnwick was considered more prestigious, Warkworth became the family's
preferred residence.[14]</p><p>The Percy family were powerful lords in northern England.
Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland (1341â€“1408), rebelled against King
Richard II and helped dethrone him. The earl later rebelled against King Henry
IV and after defeating the earl in the Battle of Shrewsbury, the king chased
him north to Alnwick. The castle surrendered under the threat of bombardment in
1403.[15]</p><p>During the Wars of the Roses, castles were infrequently
engaged in battle and conflict was generally based around combat in the field.
Alnwick was one of three castles held by Lancastrian forces in 1461 and 1462,
and it was there that the "only practical defence of a private
castle" was made according to military historian D. J. Cathcart King.[16]
It was held against King Edward until its surrender in mid-September 1461 after
the Battle of Towton. Re-captured by Sir William Tailboys, during the winter it
was surrendered by him to Hastings, Sir John Howard and Sir Ralph Grey of Heton
in late July 1462. Grey was appointed captain but surrendered after a sharp
siege in the early autumn. King Edward responded with vigour and when the Earl
of Warwick arrived in November Queen Margaret and her French advisor, Pierre de
BrÃ©zÃ© were forced to sail to Scotland for help. They organised a mainly Scots
relief force which, under George Douglas, 4th Earl of Angus and de BrÃ©zÃ©, set
out on 22 November. Warwick's army, commanded by the experienced Earl of Kent
and the recently pardoned Lord Scales, prevented news getting through to the
starving garrisons. As a result the nearby Bamburgh and Dunstanburgh castles
soon agreed terms and surrendered. But Hungerford and Whittingham held Alnwick
until Warwick was forced to withdraw when de Breze and Angus arrived on 5
January 1463.</p><p>The Lancastrians missed a chance to bring Warwick to battle
instead being content to retire, leaving behind only a token force which
surrendered next day.</p><p>Alnwick Castle, chromolithograph by Alexander Francis Lydon,
1870</p><p>By May 1463 Alnwick was in Lancastrian hands for the third
time since Towton, betrayed by Grey of Heton who tricked the commander, Sir
John Astley. Astley was imprisoned and Hungerford resumed command.</p><p>After Montagu's triumphs at Hedgeley Moor and Hexham in 1464
Warwick arrived before Alnwick on 23 June and received its surrender next day.</p><p>After the execution of Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of
Northumberland, in 1572 Alnwick castle was uninhabited.[12] In the second half
of the 18th century Robert Adam carried out many alterations. The interiors
were largely in a Strawberry Hill gothic style not at all typical of his work,
which was usually neoclassical.</p><p>However in the 19th century Algernon, 4th Duke of
Northumberland replaced much of Adam's architecture. Instead he paid Anthony
Salvin Â£250,000 between 1854 and 1865 to remove the Gothic additions and other
architectural work. Salvin is mostly responsible for the kitchen, the Prudhoe Tower,
the palatial accommodation, and the layout of the inner ward.[17] According to
the official website a large amount of Adam's work survives, but little or none
of it remains in the principal rooms shown to the public, which were
redecorated in an opulent Italianate style in the Victorian era by Luigi
Canina.</p><h2>Current use</h2><p>The exterior of Alnwick Castle from the north west</p><p>The current duke and his family live in the castle, but
occupy only a part of it. The castle is open to the public throughout the
summer. After Windsor Castle, it is the second largest inhabited castle in
England.[9][18] Alnwick was the tenth most-visited stately home in England
according to the Historic Houses Association, with 195,504 visitors in
2006.[19]</p><p>Since World War II, parts of the castle have been used by
various educational establishments: Firstly, by the Newcastle upon Tyne Church
High School; then, from 1945 to 1977, as Alnwick College of Education, a
teacher training college; and, since 1981, by St. Cloud State University of
Minnesota as a branch campus forming part of their International Study
Programme.</p><p>Special exhibitions are housed in three of the castle's
perimeter towers. The Postern Tower, as well as featuring an exhibition on the
Dukes of Northumberland and their interest in archaeology, includes frescoes
from Pompeii, relics from Ancient Egypt and Romano-British objects. Constable's
Tower houses military displays like the Percy Tenantry Volunteers exhibition,
local volunteer soldiers raised to repel Napoleon's planned invasion in the
period 1798â€“1814. The Abbot's Tower houses the Regimental Museum of the Royal
Northumberland Fusiliers.</p><p>The castle has been used as a location in feature films such
as Becket, The Black Adder, and Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.[citation needed]
An increase in public interest in the castle was generated by its use as a
stand-in for the exterior and interior of Hogwarts in the Harry Potter
films.[9] Its appearance in the films has helped shape the public imagination
regarding what castles should look like. Its condition contrasts with the vast
majority of castles in the country, which are ruinous and unfit for habitation.[20]
The wide angle images are computer generated.[citation needed]</p><p>The castle grounds are also regularly in use as a cross
country running venue as part of the North East Harrier League.[citation
needed]</p><p>The castle was also used as the location for part of filming
of the final episode of Downton Abbey, shown on 25 December 2015.</p><h2>Construction</h2><p>Alnwick Castle by Canaletto, circa 1750</p><p>The River Aln flows past the north side of the Castle. There
is a deep ravine to the south and east, separating the castle from the
town.[21] By the 12th century, Alnwick Castle had assumed the general layout
which it retains today. It is distinguished as one of the earliest castles in
England to be built without a square keep.[9] The castle consists of two main
rings of buildings. The inner ring is set around a small courtyard and contains
the principal rooms. This structure is at the centre of a large bailey. As the
central block was not large enough to contain all the accommodations required
in later centuries, a large range of buildings was constructed along the south
wall of the bailey. These two main areas of accommodation are connected by a
link building. There are towers at regular intervals along the walls of the
outer bailey. About a sixth of the bailey wall has been reduced almost to
ground level on the bailey side to open up views into the park. Stable and
service yards adjoin the castle outside the bailey; these would not have
existed when the castle still had a military function.</p><p>Alnwick Castle has two parks. Immediately to the north of
the castle is a relatively small park straddling the River Aln which was
landscaped by Lancelot Brown ("Capability Brown") and Thomas Call in
the 18th century; it is known locally as The Pastures. Nearby is the much larger
Hulne Park, which contains the remains of Hulne Priory.</p><p>The castle is in good repair and used for many purposes. It
provides a home for the present Duke and family and offices for Northumberland
Estates, which manages the Duke's extensive farming and property holdings.</p><p>Alnwick's battlements are surmounted by carved figures
dating from around 1300; historian Matthew Johnson notes that around this time
there were several castles in northern England similarly decorated, such as
Bothal, Lumley, and Raby.[22]</p><h2>Alnwick Garden</h2><p>Main article: The Alnwick Garden</p><p>The cascade fountain in The Alnwick Garden.</p><p>Adjacent to the castle, Jane Percy, Duchess of
Northumberland, has initiated the establishment of The Alnwick Garden, a formal
garden set around a cascading fountain. It cost Â£42 million (press release of 7
August 2003). The garden belongs to a charitable trust which is separate from
the Northumberland Estates, but the Duke of Northumberland donated the 42-acre
(17 ha) site and Â£9 million. The garden is designed by Jacques Wirtz and Peter
Wirtz of Wirtz International based in Schoten, Belgium. The first phase of
development, opened in October 2001, involved the creation of the fountain and
initial planting of the gardens. In 2004 a large 6,000 sq ft (560 m2) 'tree
house' complex, including a cafe, was opened. It is deemed one of the largest
tree houses in the world.</p><p>In February 2005, a poison garden, growing plants such as
cannabis and opium poppy, was added. May 2006 saw the opening of a pavilion and
visitor centre designed by Sir Michael Hopkins and Buro Happold which can hold
up to 1,000 people.[23]</p><p>As of 2011, there are still several areas to be completed,
in order to fulfil the original design.</p></div></article></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="64"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="65"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="66"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="67"><span data-reactid="68"><!-- react-empty: 69 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="70"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="71">Alnwick Castle, North UK</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="72"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="73"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="74"></div></div></div></section></div></div>

The design is humanist-inspired and takes cues from Avenir and Franklin Gothic according to the designer. It is a favorite programming font of many developers due to its crisp and clear on-screen rendering.
