# Windsor Castle, South London
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a6466429743024a42f2c2878a3c8476875ce157b.jpg)

Windsor Castle is a royal residence at Windsor in the
English county of Berkshire. The castle is notable for its long association
with the English and later British royal family and also for its architecture.
The original castle was built in the 11th century after the Norman invasion by
William the Conqueror. Since the time of Henry I, it has been used by
succeeding monarchs and is the longest-occupied palace in Europe. 

The castle's
lavish, early 19th-century State Apartments are architecturally significant,
described by art historian Hugh Roberts as "a superb and unrivalled
sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of
later Georgian taste". The castle includes the 15th-century St George's
Chapel, considered by historian John Martin Robinson to be "one of the
supreme achievements of English Perpendicular Gothic" design. More than
500 people live and work in Windsor Castle.
