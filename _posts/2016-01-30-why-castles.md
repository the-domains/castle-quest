# Why Castles?
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8f8700b4-9dab-4b54-8bcd-ec2c16e0303a.JPG)

This is where I'm going to put into words why I love Knights, Castles and Dragons so much. ![Braveheart](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b49042a6-823b-4487-bfb8-6feca09fc7a9.JPG)

## Movies made me do it. 

And how Film is what did it. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/487a0b49-9b2b-4312-a20d-38c80942355e.png)

## Strive to be like them.

Knights might never have been as virtious or as turthful as we are led to believe. (just read a "Confederate Yankee in King Arthur's Court" by Mark Twain) but that doesn't mean 10 years can't believe in them!

## What left?

Well There aren't really Dragons. Knights don't ware armor or carry swords any more (unless your gun company name is Sword), BUT there are still Castles around. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8fbd9d95-89d4-4c90-83e7-7b8505630025.jpg)
