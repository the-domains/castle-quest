# Caerphilly Castle

Caerphilly Castle (Welsh: Castell Caerffili) is a medieval
fortification in Caerphilly in South Wales. The castle was constructed by
Gilbert de Clare in the 13th century as part of his campaign to conquer
Glamorgan, and saw extensive fighting between Gilbert and his descendants and
the native Welsh rulers. Surrounded by extensive artificial lakes -- considered
by historian Allen Brown to be "the most elaborate water defences in all
Britain" -- it occupies around 30 acres (12 ha) and is the second largest
castle in Britain.\[1\] It is famous for having introduced concentric castle
defences to Britain and for its large gatehouses.

Gilbert began work on the castle in 1268 following his
occupation of the north of Glamorgan, with the majority of the construction
occurring over the next three years at a considerable cost. The project was
opposed by Gilbert's Welsh rival Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, leading to the site
being burnt in 1270 and taken over by royal officials in 1271\. Despite these
interruptions, Gilbert successfully completed the castle and took control of
the region. The core of Caerphilly Castle, including the castle's luxurious
accommodation, was built on what became a central island, surrounding by
several artificial lakes, a design Gilbert probably derived from that at
Kenilworth. The dams for these lakes were further fortified, and an island to
the west provided additional protection. The concentric rings of walls inspired
Edward I's castles in North Wales, and proved what historian Norman Pounds has
termed "a turning point in the history of the castle in Britain".\[2\]

The castle was attacked during the Madog ap Llywelyn revolt
of 1294, the Llywelyn Bren uprising in 1316 and during the overthrow of Edward
II in 1326--27\. In the late 15th century, however, it fell into decline and by
the 16th century the lakes had drained away and the walls were robbed of their
stone. The Marquesses of Bute acquired the property in 1776 and under the third
and fourth Marquesses extensive restoration took place. In 1950 the castle and
grounds were given to the state and the water defences were re-flooded. In the
21st century, the Welsh heritage agency Cadw manages the site as a tourist
attraction.
