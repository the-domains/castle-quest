# Bamburgh Castle, Edinburgh North UK

King Arthur (2004) was filmed here! Built on a dolerite outcrop, the location was previously
home to a fort of the native Britons known as Din Guarie and may have been the
capital of the British kingdom of the region (see Gododdin, Bryneich and Hen
Ogledd)\[2\] from the realm's foundation in c.420 until 547, the year of the
first written reference to the castle. In that year the citadel was captured by
the Anglo-Saxon ruler Ida of Bernicia (Beornice) and became Ida's seat. It was
briefly retaken by the Britons from his son Hussa during the war of 590 before
being relieved later the same year.

His grandson Æðelfriþ passed it on to his wife Bebba, from
whom the early name Bebbanburgh was derived. The Vikings destroyed the original
fortification in 993\.

The Normans built a new castle on the site, which forms the
core of the present one. William II unsuccessfully besieged it in 1095 during a
revolt supported by its owner, Robert de Mowbray, Earl of Northumbria. After
Robert was captured, his wife continued the defence until coerced to surrender
by the king's threat to blind her husband.

Bamburgh then became the property of the reigning English
monarch. Henry II probably built the keep. As an important English outpost, the
castle was the target of occasional raids from Scotland.\[citation needed\]
During the civil wars at the end of King John's reign, it was under the control
of Philip of Oldcoates.\[3\] In 1464 during the Wars of the Roses, it became the
first castle in England to be defeated by artillery, at the end of a nine-month
siege by Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick.

The Forster family of Northumberland\[4\] provided the Crown
with twelve successive governors of the castle for some 400 years until the
Crown granted ownership to Sir John Forster. The family retained ownership
until Sir William Forster (d. 1700) was posthumously declared bankrupt, and his
estates, including the castle, were sold to Lord Crew, Bishop of Durham
(husband of his sister Dorothy) under an Act of Parliament to settle the debts.

The castle deteriorated but was restored by various owners
during the 18th and 19th centuries. It was finally bought by the Victorian
industrialist William Armstrong, who completed the restoration.

During the Second World War, the Royal Navy corvette HMS
Bamborough Castle was named after it.

The castle still belongs to the Armstrong family, and is
opened to the public. It also hosts weddings and corporate events. It has been
used as a film location since the 1920s, featuring in films such as Ivanhoe
(1982), El Cid (1961), Mary, Queen of Scots (1971), Elizabeth (1998) and both
the 1971 and 2015 adaptions of Macbeth.
