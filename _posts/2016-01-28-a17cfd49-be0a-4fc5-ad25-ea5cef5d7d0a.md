# Conway Castle, North Wales

Conwy Castle (Welsh: Castell Conwy, English: Conway Castle)
is a medieval fortification in Conwy, on the north coast of Wales. It was built
by Edward I, during his conquest of Wales, between 1283 and 1289\. Constructed
as part of a wider project to create the walled town of Conwy, the combined
defences cost around £15,000, a huge sum for the period. Over the next few centuries,
the castle played an important part in several wars. It withstood the siege of
Madog ap Llywelyn in the winter of 1294--95, acted as a temporary haven for
Richard II in 1399 and was held for several months by forces loyal to Owain
Glyndŵr in 1401\.

Following the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, the
castle was held by forces loyal to Charles I, holding out until 1646 when it
surrendered to the Parliamentary armies. In the aftermath the castle was
partially slighted by Parliament to prevent it being used in any further
revolt, and was finally completely ruined in 1665 when its remaining iron and
lead was stripped and sold off. Conwy Castle became an attractive destination
for painters in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Visitor numbers grew
and initial restoration work was carried out in the second half of the 19th
century. In the 21st century the ruined castle is managed by Cadw as a tourist
attraction.

UNESCO considers Conwy to be one of "the finest
examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in
Europe", and it is classed as a World Heritage site.\[1\] The rectangular
castle is built from local and imported stone and occupies a coastal ridge,
originally overlooking an important crossing point over the River Conwy.
Divided into an Inner and an Outer Ward, it is defended by eight large towers
and two barbicans, with a postern gate leading down to the river, allowing the
castle to be resupplied from the sea. It retains the earliest surviving stone
machicolations in Britain and what historian Jeremy Ashbee has described as the
"best preserved suite of medieval private royal chambers in England and
Wales".\[2\] In keeping with other Edwardian castles in North Wales, the
architecture of Conwy has close links to that found in the kingdom of Savoy
during the same period, an influence probably derived from the Savoy origins of
the main architect, James of Saint George.
