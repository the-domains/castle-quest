# Caernarfon Castle, West Wales

Caernarfon Castle (Welsh: Castell Caernarfon) is a medieval
fortress in Caernarfon, Gwynedd, north-west Wales cared for by Cadw, the Welsh
Government's historic environment service. There was a motte-and-bailey castle
in the town of Caernarfon from the late 11th century until 1283 when King
Edward I of England began replacing it with the current stone structure. The
Edwardian town and castle acted as the administrative centre of north Wales and
as a result the defences were built on a grand scale. There was a deliberate
link with Caernarfon's Roman past and the Roman fort of Segontium is nearby.

While the castle was under construction, town walls were
built around Caernarfon. The work cost between £20,000 and £25,000 from the
start until the end of work in 1330\. Despite Caernarfon Castle's external
appearance of being mostly complete, the interior buildings no longer survive
and many of the building plans were never finished. The town and castle were
sacked in 1294 when Madog ap Llywelyn led a rebellion against the English.
Caernarfon was recaptured the following year. During the Glyndŵr Rising of
1400--1415, the castle was besieged. When the Tudor dynasty ascended to the
English throne in 1485, tensions between the Welsh and English began to
diminish and castles were considered less important. As a result, Caernarfon
Castle was allowed to fall into a state of disrepair.

Despite its dilapidated condition, during the English Civil
War Caernarfon Castle was held by Royalists, and was besieged three times by
Parliamentarian forces. This was the last time the castle was used in war.
Caernarfon Castle was neglected until the 19th century when the state funded
repairs. In 1911, Caernarfon Castle was used for the investiture of the Prince
of Wales, and again in 1969\. It is part of the World Heritage Site
"Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd".\[1\]
