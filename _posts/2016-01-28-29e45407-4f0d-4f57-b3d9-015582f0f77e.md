* At AoM we're great champions of[the lost art of letter writing][0]. Emails, texting, and the wide variety of other digital mediums available to us in the modern age are convenient and efficient, but they can't hold a candle to the warm, tangible, classy nature of handwritten correspondence. Letters are the next best thing to showing up personally at someone's door.

Of course, snail mail doesn't need to replace our digital messaging --- it's just a satisfying activity (and even hobby, if you'd like) to take part in from time to time. It's nice to have a pen pal or two you correspond with through real letters; being able to open the mailbox and find an envelope addressed to you is a true delight. Beyond basic correspondence, there are 7 types of letters I suggest every man write at least once before they turn 70\. Each kind of letter described below covers a different part of the human experience, and provides a benefit to both the writer and the recipient (though you don't have to send them all). The former gets to participate in the exercise of putting words to feelings, a process that can hone gratitude, humility, and perspective on life. The latter gets to open an envelope filled with comfort and encouragement. It's win-win.

With most of these types of letters, doing it once is definitely just the minimum goal. Making their writing a regular habit will keep the benefits flowing to you and the lucky recipients of your notes -- until you're 70 and beyond.
