description: 'Of course, snail mail doesn’t need to replace our digital messaging — it’s just a satisfying activity (and even hobby, if you’d like) to take part in from time to time. It’s nice to have a pen pal or two you correspond with through real letters; being able to open the mailbox and find an envelope addressed to you is a true delight. Beyond basic correspondence, there are 7 types of letters I suggest every man write at least once before they turn 70. Each kind of letter described below covers a different part of the human experience, and provides a benefit to both the writer and the recipient (though you don’t have to send them all). The former gets to participate in the exercise of putting words to feelings, a process that can hone gratitude, humility, and perspective on life. The latter gets to open an envelope filled with comfort and encouragement. It’s win-win.'

# Raglan Castle, Wales

Raglan Castle (Welsh: Castell Rhaglan) is a late medieval
castle located just north of the village of Raglan in the county of
Monmouthshire in south east Wales. The modern castle dates from between the
15th and early 17th-centuries, when the successive ruling families of the
Herberts and the Somersets created a luxurious, fortified castle, complete with
a large hexagonal keep, known as the Great Tower or the Yellow Tower of Gwent.
Surrounded by parkland, water gardens and terraces, the castle was considered
by contemporaries to be the equal of any other in England or Wales. 

## History

During the
English Civil War the castle was held on behalf of Charles I and was taken by
Parliamentary forces in 1646\. In the aftermath, the castle was slighted, or
deliberately put beyond military use; after the restoration of Charles II, the
Somersets declined to restore the castle. Raglan Castle became first a source
of local building materials, then a romantic ruin, and is now a modern tourist
attraction.
