# Budgets

Flight LAX to Malta = ~$1000

Flight - Malta to UK = $120

Flight - London to LAX = $650

14 Days of Hostels x $35 = $490

18 Days food x $30/day = $540

Travel through UK = ~$500?

Fun = ~$500

Castle Tours+Specific Travel = ~$500

## Total $4300 +/- $500 = $4800

- $500 for Credit card bonus

-$1000 total donations? (Complete guess)

## Total $4800-$1500 = $3,300

Spend $4,000 in first three months to get $650 in points for a flight (if I book through them. 

## Journal Entry - 2/5/2016

- I just applied and was approved for my Chase Sapphire card! I'm a little worred about using it to get the flights I want, when I want. But I'm excited that all the points I use/gain become basically free money on the flight. I just need to be really good about paying it down. Which usually I am but I feel behind the payment curve on my bills. NO MORE! I'm hoping to getting ahead of it all and then have an AUTO-PAYMENT sent up that always pays the full amount. 

I'm going to look into American Airlines card as well because I might be able to do the same trick with them. But since thats also a spend x $$$ in X time I need to wait till I hit the number for Sapphire.
