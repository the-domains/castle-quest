Marian and Brian live somewhere on Malta. Working out where and how exactly to get there and back out again. 

## Wiki Article about Malta

Malta (Listeni/ˈmɒltə/; Maltese: \[ˈmɐltɐ\]), officially the
Republic of Malta (Maltese: Repubblika ta' Malta), is a Southern European
island country comprising an archipelago in the Mediterranean Sea. It lies 80
km (50 mi) south of Italy, 284 km (176 mi) east of Tunisia, and 333 km (207 mi)
north of Libya. The country covers just over 316 km2 (122 sq mi), with a
population of just under 450,000 (despite an extensive emigration programme
since the Second World War),\[2\] making it one of the world's smallest\[7\]\[8\]\[9\]
and most densely populated countries. The capital of Malta is Valletta, which
at 0.8 km2, is the smallest national capital in the European Union.\[10\] Malta
has two official languages: Maltese and English.

Malta's location has historically given it great strategic
importance as a naval base, and a succession of powers, including the
Phoenicians, Romans, Moors, Normans, Sicilians, Spanish, Knights of St. John,
French and British, have ruled the islands.

Malta was awarded the George Cross by King George VI in
1942, for the country's bravery in the Second World War.\[11\] The George Cross
continues to appear on Malta's national flag.\[12\] Under the Malta Independence
Act, passed by the British Parliament in 1964, Malta gained independence from
the United Kingdom as an independent sovereign Commonwealth realm, officially
known from 1964 to 1974 as the State of Malta, with Elizabeth II as its head of
state.\[13\] The country became a republic in 1974, and although no longer a
Commonwealth realm, remains a current member state of the Commonwealth of
Nations. Malta was admitted to the United Nations in 1964 and to the European
Union in 2004; in 2008, it became part of the Eurozone.

Malta has a long Christian legacy and its Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of Malta is claimed to be an Apostolic See because, according to
the Acts of the Apostles, Paul the Apostle was shipwrecked on Malta.
Catholicism is the official religion in Malta.

Malta is a popular tourist destination with its warm
climate, numerous recreational areas, and architectural and historical
monuments, including three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Ħal Saflieni
Hypogeum,\[18\] Valletta,\[19\] and seven Megalithic Temples, which are some of the
oldest free-standing structures in the world.
