> I'm going to try and take a 2-3 week Backpacking trip through parts of Europe to see the top "Medieval style, battle harden, awesome, no FRU FRU Castles there are. The trip will have three phases: 

1\. See my Aunt and Uncle in Malta 

2\. Travel to the UK to see Castles in Wales, Edinburgh and South of London

3\. Do something totally not planned.
