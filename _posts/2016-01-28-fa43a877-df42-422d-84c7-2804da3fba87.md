> I'm going to try and take a 2-3 week Backpacking trip through parts of Europe to see the top "Medieval style, battle harden, awesome, no FRU FRU Castles there are. The trip will have three phases: 

1\. See my Aunt and Uncle in Malta 

2\. Travel to the UK to see Castles in Wales, Edinburgh and South of London

3\. Do something totally not planned.

Arianna's notes for ENG if you end up there:
-- Museum of Torture in York, England
--Go to York\*\*\*\*\*
--Lewes, England -- Henry the 8th used to keep all his wives there and built castles for them
--Hastings battle of 1066
--the Yorshire Moores - northern England
