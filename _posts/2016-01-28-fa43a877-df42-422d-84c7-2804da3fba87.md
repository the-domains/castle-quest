# Europe Plans

I'm going to try and take a 2-3 week Backpacking trip through parts of Europe to see the top "Medieval style, battle harden, Bad ass, no FRU FRU Castles there are. The trip will have three phases:

## 1\. See my Aunt and Uncle in Malta

## 2\. Travel to the UK to see Castles in Wales, Sussex and South of London. 

## 3\. Do something totally not planned.
