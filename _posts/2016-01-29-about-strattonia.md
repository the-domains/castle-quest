# Tyler Stratton is on a journey

My 30th Birthday is coming up (July 8th) and recently I thought about what is the coolest possible thing I could do to celebrate (within the natural laws of physics that is). I always love parties with my loved one but I felt I should think bigger this year. I pondered what are the coolest things you've ever done Tyler? Heres a short highlights list:

* Plan, and execute "The Game" for my Brother [(Click here for link!)][0]
* Compete in The [Star Wars Card Game World Championships][1]
* Go on tour with my Brother and the band [Dopapod][2]
* Epic Murder Mystery Parties (Thanks Chandra).
* Numerous vacations with family to awesome places.
* See Rozafa Castle in Albania

Now there are many more amazing things I've done in my life but one of those I'd love to more of. I realized that seeing that castle in Albania was so epic, why can't I see more?!

Which brings us here. I'm going to try and take a 2-3 week Backpacking trip through parts of Europe to see the top "Medieval style, battle harden, Bad ass, no FRU FRU Castles there are. The trip will have three phases:

## 1\. See my Aunt and Uncle in Malta

## 2\. Travel to the UK to see Castles in Wales, Sussex and South of London. 

## 3\. Do something totally not planned.

Right now I'm in the process of planning the trip and finding the castles I'd like to see. This website is a creation of "The Grid" which I'm beta testing. 

If you have any thoughts about my trip ideas or improvements to this site please email me at:

Sincerely,

Tyler "The King of Strattonia" Strattton
