            <title><![CDATA[Caerphilly Castle]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Caerphilly Castle</h1><p>Gilbert began work on the castle in 1268 following his
occupation of the north of Glamorgan, with the majority of the construction
occurring over the next three years at a considerable cost. The project was
opposed by Gilbert's Welsh rival Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, leading to the site
being burnt in 1270 and taken over by royal officials in 1271. Despite these
interruptions, Gilbert successfully completed the castle and took control of
the region. The core of Caerphilly Castle, including the castle's luxurious
accommodation, was built on what became a central island, surrounding by
several artificial lakes, a design Gilbert probably derived from that at
Kenilworth. The dams for these lakes were further fortified, and an island to
the west provided additional protection. The concentric rings of walls inspired
Edward I's castles in North Wales, and proved what historian Norman Pounds has
termed "a turning point in the history of the castle in Britain".[2]</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b8367dc597c9d8fc6dd8af8c353cd3fe4acada2e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Windsor Castle, South London]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Windsor Castle, South London</h1><p>Windsor Castle is a royal residence at Windsor in the
English county of Berkshire. The castle is notable for its long association
with the English and later British royal family and also for its architecture.
The original castle was built in the 11th century after the Norman invasion by
William the Conqueror. Since the time of Henry I, it has been used by
succeeding monarchs and is the longest-occupied palace in Europe. The castle's
lavish, early 19th-century State Apartments are architecturally significant,
described by art historian Hugh Roberts as "a superb and unrivalled
sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of
later Georgian taste". The castle includes the 15th-century St George's
Chapel, considered by historian John Martin Robinson to be "one of the
supreme achievements of English Perpendicular Gothic" design. More than
500 people live and work in Windsor Castle.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a6466429743024a42f2c2878a3c8476875ce157b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Caernarfon Castle, West Wales]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Caernarfon Castle, West Wales</h1><p>While the castle was under construction, town walls were
built around Caernarfon. The work cost between £20,000 and £25,000 from the
start until the end of work in 1330. Despite Caernarfon Castle's external
appearance of being mostly complete, the interior buildings no longer survive
and many of the building plans were never finished. The town and castle were
sacked in 1294 when Madog ap Llywelyn led a rebellion against the English.
Caernarfon was recaptured the following year. During the Glyndŵr Rising of
1400–1415, the castle was besieged. When the Tudor dynasty ascended to the
English throne in 1485, tensions between the Welsh and English began to
diminish and castles were considered less important. As a result, Caernarfon
Castle was allowed to fall into a state of disrepair.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a27f4d1f89e70c7d7c1670f27e5aff4734afef96.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Raglan Castle, Wales]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Raglan Castle, Wales</h1><p>Raglan Castle (Welsh: Castell Rhaglan) is a late medieval
castle located just north of the village of Raglan in the county of
Monmouthshire in south east Wales. The modern castle dates from between the
15th and early 17th-centuries, when the successive ruling families of the
Herberts and the Somersets created a luxurious, fortified castle, complete with
a large hexagonal keep, known as the Great Tower or the Yellow Tower of Gwent.
Surrounded by parkland, water gardens and terraces, the castle was considered
by contemporaries to be the equal of any other in England or Wales. During the
English Civil War the castle was held on behalf of Charles I and was taken by
Parliamentary forces in 1646. In the aftermath, the castle was slighted, or
deliberately put beyond military use; after the restoration of Charles II, the
Somersets declined to restore the castle. Raglan Castle became first a source
of local building materials, then a romantic ruin, and is now a modern tourist
attraction.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a3caa812102512586b146b2433b7baf6c4b7f2d1.jpg"></article>]]></description>
