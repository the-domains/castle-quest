            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bamburgh Castle, Edinburgh North UK</h1><p>King Arthur (2004) was filmed here! Built on a dolerite outcrop, the location was previously
home to a fort of the native Britons known as Din Guarie and may have been the
capital of the British kingdom of the region (see Gododdin, Bryneich and Hen
Ogledd)[2] from the realm's foundation in c.420 until 547, the year of the
first written reference to the castle. In that year the citadel was captured by
the Anglo-Saxon ruler Ida of Bernicia (Beornice) and became Ida's seat. It was
briefly retaken by the Britons from his son Hussa during the war of 590 before
being relieved later the same year.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2e2da173c80eecf0d89bfe64d19d2469d278a892.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Windsor Castle, South London</h1><p>Windsor Castle is a royal residence at Windsor in the
English county of Berkshire. The castle is notable for its long association
with the English and later British royal family and also for its architecture.
The original castle was built in the 11th century after the Norman invasion by
William the Conqueror. Since the time of Henry I, it has been used by
succeeding monarchs and is the longest-occupied palace in Europe. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ff74506ec4a51f9168f524290836e0e32cd9c695.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Caernarfon Castle, West Wales]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Caernarfon Castle, West Wales</h1><p>While the castle was under construction, town walls were
built around Caernarfon. The work cost between £20,000 and £25,000 from the
start until the end of work in 1330. Despite Caernarfon Castle's external
appearance of being mostly complete, the interior buildings no longer survive
and many of the building plans were never finished. The town and castle were
sacked in 1294 when Madog ap Llywelyn led a rebellion against the English.
Caernarfon was recaptured the following year. During the Glyndŵr Rising of
1400–1415, the castle was besieged. When the Tudor dynasty ascended to the
English throne in 1485, tensions between the Welsh and English began to
diminish and castles were considered less important. As a result, Caernarfon
Castle was allowed to fall into a state of disrepair.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/036b62dde5d76a7b37e02ef932b4995df1c8d12e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Raglan Castle, Wales</h1><p>Raglan Castle (Welsh: Castell Rhaglan) is a late medieval
castle located just north of the village of Raglan in the county of
Monmouthshire in south east Wales. The modern castle dates from between the
15th and early 17th-centuries, when the successive ruling families of the
Herberts and the Somersets created a luxurious, fortified castle, complete with
a large hexagonal keep, known as the Great Tower or the Yellow Tower of Gwent.
Surrounded by parkland, water gardens and terraces, the castle was considered
by contemporaries to be the equal of any other in England or Wales. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d90da60fa03b05bfc6848b01a9050acceb1cfa46.jpg"></article>]]></description>
