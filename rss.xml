            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Raglan Castle, Wales</h1><p>Raglan Castle (Welsh: Castell Rhaglan) is a late medieval
castle located just north of the village of Raglan in the county of
Monmouthshire in south east Wales. The modern castle dates from between the
15th and early 17th-centuries, when the successive ruling families of the
Herberts and the Somersets created a luxurious, fortified castle, complete with
a large hexagonal keep, known as the Great Tower or the Yellow Tower of Gwent.
Surrounded by parkland, water gardens and terraces, the castle was considered
by contemporaries to be the equal of any other in England or Wales. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a3caa812102512586b146b2433b7baf6c4b7f2d1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bamburgh Castle, Edinburgh North UK</h1><p>King Arthur (2004) was filmed here! Built on a dolerite outcrop, the location was previously
home to a fort of the native Britons known as Din Guarie and may have been the
capital of the British kingdom of the region (see Gododdin, Bryneich and Hen
Ogledd)[2] from the realm's foundation in c.420 until 547, the year of the
first written reference to the castle. In that year the citadel was captured by
the Anglo-Saxon ruler Ida of Bernicia (Beornice) and became Ida's seat. It was
briefly retaken by the Britons from his son Hussa during the war of 590 before
being relieved later the same year.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a745ecee73cd45127a976a80f5b087ca206e2b86.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Caerphilly Castle]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Caerphilly Castle</h1><p>Gilbert began work on the castle in 1268 following his
occupation of the north of Glamorgan, with the majority of the construction
occurring over the next three years at a considerable cost. The project was
opposed by Gilbert's Welsh rival Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, leading to the site
being burnt in 1270 and taken over by royal officials in 1271. Despite these
interruptions, Gilbert successfully completed the castle and took control of
the region. The core of Caerphilly Castle, including the castle's luxurious
accommodation, was built on what became a central island, surrounding by
several artificial lakes, a design Gilbert probably derived from that at
Kenilworth. The dams for these lakes were further fortified, and an island to
the west provided additional protection. The concentric rings of walls inspired
Edward I's castles in North Wales, and proved what historian Norman Pounds has
termed "a turning point in the history of the castle in Britain".[2]</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b8367dc597c9d8fc6dd8af8c353cd3fe4acada2e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

English county of Berkshire. The castle is notable for its long association
with the English and later British royal family and also for its architecture.
The original castle was built in the 11th century after the Norman invasion by
William the Conqueror. Since the time of Henry I, it has been used by
succeeding monarchs and is the longest-occupied palace in Europe. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a6466429743024a42f2c2878a3c8476875ce157b.jpg"></article>]]></description>
