            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Caerphilly Castle</h1><p>Caerphilly Castle (Welsh: Castell Caerffili) is a medieval
fortification in Caerphilly in South Wales. The castle was constructed by
Gilbert de Clare in the 13th century as part of his campaign to conquer
Glamorgan, and saw extensive fighting between Gilbert and his descendants and
the native Welsh rulers. Surrounded by extensive artificial lakes – considered
by historian Allen Brown to be "the most elaborate water defences in all
Britain" – it occupies around 30 acres (12 ha) and is the second largest
castle in Britain.[1] It is famous for having introduced concentric castle
defences to Britain and for its large gatehouses.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bamburgh Castle, Edinburgh North UK</h1><p>King Arthur (2004) was filmed here! Built on a dolerite outcrop, the location was previously
home to a fort of the native Britons known as Din Guarie and may have been the
capital of the British kingdom of the region (see Gododdin, Bryneich and Hen
Ogledd)[2] from the realm's foundation in c.420 until 547, the year of the
first written reference to the castle. In that year the citadel was captured by
the Anglo-Saxon ruler Ida of Bernicia (Beornice) and became Ida's seat. It was
briefly retaken by the Britons from his son Hussa during the war of 590 before
being relieved later the same year.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2e2da173c80eecf0d89bfe64d19d2469d278a892.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Windsor Castle, South London</h1><p>Windsor Castle is a royal residence at Windsor in the
English county of Berkshire. The castle is notable for its long association
with the English and later British royal family and also for its architecture.
The original castle was built in the 11th century after the Norman invasion by

succeeding monarchs and is the longest-occupied palace in Europe. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ff74506ec4a51f9168f524290836e0e32cd9c695.jpg"></article>]]></description>
