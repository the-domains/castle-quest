            <title><![CDATA[Caernarfon Castle, West Wales]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Caernarfon Castle, West Wales</h1><p>While the castle was under construction, town walls were
built around Caernarfon. The work cost between £20,000 and £25,000 from the
start until the end of work in 1330. Despite Caernarfon Castle's external
appearance of being mostly complete, the interior buildings no longer survive
and many of the building plans were never finished. The town and castle were
sacked in 1294 when Madog ap Llywelyn led a rebellion against the English.
Caernarfon was recaptured the following year. During the Glyndŵr Rising of
1400–1415, the castle was besieged. When the Tudor dynasty ascended to the
English throne in 1485, tensions between the Welsh and English began to
diminish and castles were considered less important. As a result, Caernarfon
Castle was allowed to fall into a state of disrepair.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c436dc8226f47aacfafe004dc355076c299793dc.jpg"></article>]]></description>
