            <title><![CDATA[Caernarfon Castle, West Wales]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Caernarfon Castle, West Wales</h1><p>While the castle was under construction, town walls were
built around Caernarfon. The work cost between £20,000 and £25,000 from the
start until the end of work in 1330. Despite Caernarfon Castle's external
appearance of being mostly complete, the interior buildings no longer survive
and many of the building plans were never finished. The town and castle were
sacked in 1294 when Madog ap Llywelyn led a rebellion against the English.
Caernarfon was recaptured the following year. During the Glyndŵr Rising of
1400–1415, the castle was besieged. When the Tudor dynasty ascended to the
English throne in 1485, tensions between the Welsh and English began to
diminish and castles were considered less important. As a result, Caernarfon
Castle was allowed to fall into a state of disrepair.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c436dc8226f47aacfafe004dc355076c299793dc.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Caerphilly Castle]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Caerphilly Castle</h1><p>Gilbert began work on the castle in 1268 following his
occupation of the north of Glamorgan, with the majority of the construction
occurring over the next three years at a considerable cost. The project was
opposed by Gilbert's Welsh rival Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, leading to the site
being burnt in 1270 and taken over by royal officials in 1271. Despite these
interruptions, Gilbert successfully completed the castle and took control of
the region. The core of Caerphilly Castle, including the castle's luxurious
accommodation, was built on what became a central island, surrounding by
several artificial lakes, a design Gilbert probably derived from that at
Kenilworth. The dams for these lakes were further fortified, and an island to
the west provided additional protection. The concentric rings of walls inspired
Edward I's castles in North Wales, and proved what historian Norman Pounds has
termed "a turning point in the history of the castle in Britain".[2]</p></article>]]></description>
