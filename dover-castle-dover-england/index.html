castle in Dover, Kent. It was
founded in the 11th century and has been described as the "Key to
England" due to its defensive significance throughout history. It is
the largest castle in England.</p><p>The Roman lighthouse at Dover Castle, the site may have been fortified with earthworks in the Iron
Age or earlier, before the Romans invaded in AD43. This is suggested on the
basis of the unusual pattern of the earthworks which does not seem to be a
perfect fit for the medieval castle. Excavations have provided evidence of Iron
Age occupation within the locality of the castle, but it is not certain whether
this is associated with the hillfort.[4] There have also been excavations on
the mound which the church and Roman Pharos are situated on, which has been
discovered to be a Bronze Age mound.</p><p>The site also contained one of Dover's two 80-foot (24 m)
Roman lighthouses (or Pharoses), one of which still survives, whilst the
remains of the other are located on the opposing Western Heights, across the
town of Dover. On the site is a classic montrol (campsite) where the Normans
landed after their victorious conquest.</p><p>The view down from the Castle to the Church, possible Saxon
burgh, and Harbour beyond.</p><p>After the Battle of Hastings in October 1066, William the
Conqueror and his forces marched to Westminster Abbey for his coronation. They
took a roundabout route via Romney, Dover, Canterbury, Surrey and Berkshire.
From the Cinque Ports foundation in 1050, Dover has always been a chief
member—it may also have been this that first attracted William's attention, and
got Kent the motto of Invicta. In the words of William of Poitiers:</p><p>Then he marched to Dover, which had been reported
impregnable and held by a large force. The English, stricken with fear at his
approach had confidence neither in their ramparts nor in the numbers of their
troops ... While the inhabitants were preparing to surrender unconditionally,
[the Normans], greedy for money, set the castle on fire and the great part of
it was soon enveloped in flames...[William then paid for the repair and] having
taken possession of the castle, the Duke spent eight days adding new
fortifications to it'. The Castle was first built, entirely out of clay. It
collapsed to the ground and the clay was then used as the flooring for many of
the ground-floor rooms.</p><p>This may have been repairs and improvements to an existing
Saxon fort or burgh, centred on the Saxon church of St Mary de Castro, although
archaeological evidence suggests that it was actually a new motte and bailey
design castle built from scratch nearby.</p><p>In 1088, eight knights were appointed under tenures to guard
Dover Castle, their names were: William d'Albrincis; Fulberl de Dover, William
d'Arsic; Geoffrey Peverell; William Maminot; Robert du Port; Hugh Crevecoeur;
and Adam Fitzwilliam.</p><h2>Henry II to early modern times</h2><p>Section of the western curtain wall leading to Peverell's
Gateway</p><p>It was during the reign of Henry II that the castle began to
take recognisable shape. The inner and outer baileys and the great keep belong
to this time. Maurice the Engineer was responsible for building the keep,[5]
one of the last rectangular keeps ever built.</p><p>In 1216, a group of rebel barons invited the future Louis
VIII of France to come and take the English crown. He had some success
breaching the walls, but was unable ultimately to take the castle (see The
First Barons' War).</p><p>The vulnerable north gate that had been breached in the
siege was converted into an underground forward-defence complex (including St
John's Tower), and new gates built into the outer curtain wall on the western
(Fitzwilliam's Gate) and eastern (Constable's Gate) sides. During the siege,
the English defenders tunnelled outwards and attacked the French, thus creating
the only counter-tunnel in the world. This can still be seen in the medieval
works.</p><p>During the time of Stephen de Pencester, a windmill was erected
on Tower 22, which was later known as the Mill Tower.[6] By the Tudor age, the
defences themselves had been superseded by gunpowder. They were improved by
Henry VIII, who made a personal visit, and added to it with the Moat Bulwark.</p><p>During the English Civil War it was held for the king but
then taken by a Parliamentarian trick without a shot being fired (hence it
avoided being ravaged and survives far better than most castles) in 1642.</p><p>Dover Castle was a crucial observation point for the
cross-channel sightings of the Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790), which used
trigonometric calculations to link the Royal Greenwich Observatory with the
Paris Observatory. This work was overseen by General William Roy. The other
English viewpoint used to make measurements across to Cap Blanc Nez in France
was at Fairlight, East Sussex.</p><h2>Dover Castle in 2011.</h2><p>Massive rebuilding took place at the end of the 18th century
during the Napoleonic Wars. William Twiss, the Commanding Engineer of the
Southern District, as part of his brief to improve the town's defences,
completed the remodelling of the outer defences of Dover Castle adding the huge
Horseshoe, Hudson's, East Arrow and East Demi-Bastions to provide extra gun
positions on the eastern side, and constructing the Constable's Bastion for
additional protection on the west. Twiss further strengthened the Spur at the
northern end of the castle, adding a redan, or raised gun platform. By taking
the roof off the keep and replacing it with massive brick vaults he was able to
mount heavy artillery on the top. Twiss also constructed Canon's Gateway to
link the defences of the castle with those of the town.</p><p>With Dover becoming a garrison town, there was a need for
barracks and storerooms for the additional troops and their equipment. The
solution adopted by Twiss and the Royal Engineers was to create a complex of
barracks tunnels about 15 metres below the cliff top and the first troops were
accommodated in 1803. At the height of the Napoleonic Wars, the tunnels housed
more than 2,000 men and to date are the only underground barracks ever built in
Britain.</p><p>The windmill on the Mill Tower was demolished during the
Anglo-American War of the orders of the Ordnance Board. It was said that the
sale of materials from the demolished mill did not cover the cost of the
demolition.[6] At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the tunnels were partly
converted and used by the Coast Blockade Service to combat smuggling. This was
a short-term endeavour though, and in 1827 the headquarters were moved closer
to shore. The tunnels then remained abandoned for more than a century.</p><h2>The secret wartime tunnels</h2><p>The Second World War Coastal Artillery Operations Room in
the Secret Wartime Tunnels</p><p>The outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 saw the tunnels
converted first into an air-raid shelter and then later into a military command
centre and underground hospital. In May 1940, Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsey
directed the evacuation of French and British soldiers from Dunkirk, code-named
Operation Dynamo, from his headquarters in the cliff tunnels.</p><p>A military telephone exchange was installed in 1941 and
served the underground headquarters. The switchboards were constantly in use
and had to have a new tunnel created alongside it to house the batteries and
chargers necessary to keep them functioning. The navy used the exchange to
enable direct communication with vessels, as well as using it to direct air-sea
rescue craft to pick up pilots shot down in the Straits of Dover.</p><p>Later the tunnels were to be used as a shelter for the
Regional Seats of Government in the event of a nuclear attack. This plan was
abandoned for various reasons, including the realisation that the chalk of the
cliffs would not provide significant protection from radiation, and because of
the inconvenient form of the tunnels and their generally poor condition.</p><p>Tunnel levels are denoted as A - Annexe, B - Bastion, C -
Casemate, D - DUMPY and E - Esplanade. Annexe and Casemate levels are open to
the public, Bastion is 'lost' but investigations continue to gain access, DUMPY
(converted from Second World War use to serve as a Regional Seat of Government
in event of an atomic war) is closed, as is Esplanade (last used as an air raid
shelter in the Second World War).[7]</p><p>The Annexe level was excavated in 1941 to serve as a medical
dressing station for wounded soldiers. It contained two operating theatres and
had basic accommodation for patients. Soldiers would be sent for emergency
treatment in the tunnels and then transferred to inland hospitals. Within the
Annexe level were dormitories, kitchens and mess rooms.</p><p>A statue of Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay was erected in
November 2000 outside the tunnels in honour of his work on the Dunkirk
evacuation and protecting Dover during the Second World War.[8]</p><p>If they were being attacked they would have to move quickly
as the enemies were just nine minutes away from Dover by plane. There are over
three miles of these Tunnels going deep down into the chalky cliffs, some still
undiscovered. There are tunnels that are far too dangerous to walk down. Full
information about these tunnels is not due to be released until 2020-2025.</p><h2>The castle today</h2><p>Dover Castle is a Scheduled Monument,[9] which means it is a
"nationally important" historic building and archaeological site that
has been given protection against unauthorised change.[10] It is also a Grade I
listed building,[11] and recognised as an internationally important
structure.[12] The castle, secret tunnels, and surrounding land are now owned
by English Heritage and the site is a major tourist attraction. The Lord Warden
of the Cinque Ports is officially head of the castle, in his conjoint position
of Constable of Dover Castle, and the Deputy Constable has his residence in
Constable's Gate.</p><p>The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment Museum is located in
the castle.</p><p>Between 2007 and 2009, English Heritage spent £2.45 million
on recreating the castle's interior.[13] According to figures released by the
Association of Leading Visitor Attractions, nearly 350,000 people visited Dover
Castle in 2010.[14]</p></div></article></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="67"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="68"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="69"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="70"><span data-reactid="71"><!-- react-empty: 72 --><h2 data-reactid="73"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="74">Dover Castle, Dover England</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="75"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="76"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="77"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
